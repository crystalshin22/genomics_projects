# Genomics Projects

Most of these projects have been completed as a class project under the supervision of Professor Wei-Yi Cheng for his course on Introduction to Genomics and Information Science at Columbia University. All of the code is either completely mine or modified after receiving instructor feedback. <br>

All data files have been provided by the course instructor and can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19Ma2yj605qYQiXjZtNaJkfohv6ZXfJhr?usp=share_link) on request. <br>

The repository is constantly updated as I complete more class/personal projects.<br>

## Outline of Projects

- **COVID Spark Protein Alignment** [[code]](https://github.com/crystalshin22/genomics_projects/blob/main/COVID_Spark_Protein_Alignment.ipynb)<br>
    - Summary: Performed a multiple sequence alignment of different COVID-19 spark protein sequences, created a phylogenetic tree of the different variants, and assigned variant identities
    - Tools: Biopython, Ipytree, MAFFT, FASTA files
    
- **Prostate Cancer Risk Screening Using Germline Variant Data** [[code]](https://github.com/crystalshin22/genomics_projects/blob/main/Prostate%20Cancer%20Risk%20Screening%20Using%20Germline%20Variant%20Data.ipynb)<br>
    - Summary: Identified pathogenic germline variants from 'Clinvar' clinical variants database that could lead to prostate cancer and screened 1000 genome project dataset to check if the subjects carry those specific variants associated with high risk of prostate cancer
    - Tools: scikit-allel, VCF, Zarr files
